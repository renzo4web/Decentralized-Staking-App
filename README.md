### Checkpoint 1: 🔭 Environment 📺

You'll have three terminals up for:

`yarn chain` (hardhat backend)

`yarn deploy` (to compile, deploy, and publish your contracts to the frontend)

`yarn start` (react app frontend)


---

### Checkpoint 2: 🥩 Staking 💵


#### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] Do you see the balance of the `Staker` contract go up when you `stake()`?
- [ ] Is your `balance` correctly tracked?
- [ ] Do you see the events in the `Staker UI` tab?

---

### Checkpoint 3: 🔬 State Machine / Timing ⏱

#### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] Can you see `timeLeft` counting down in the `Staker UI` tab when you trigger a transaction with the faucet?
- [ ] If you `stake()` enough ETH before the `deadline`, does it call `complete()`?
- [ ] If you don't `stake()` enough can you `withdraw(address payable)` your funds?

---

### Checkpoint 4: 💵 Receive Function / UX 🙎


#### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] If you send ETH directly to the contract address does it update your `balance`?

---

## ⚔️ Side Quests

- [ ] Can execute get called more than once, and is that okay?
- [ ] Can you stake and withdraw freely after the `deadline`, and is that okay?
- [ ] What are other implications of _anyone_ being able to withdraw for someone?

---

## 🐸 It's a trap!

- [ ] Make sure funds can't get trapped in the contract! **Try sending funds after you have executed! What happens?**
- [ ] Try to create a [modifier](https://solidity-by-example.org/function-modifier/) called `notCompleted`. It will check that `ExampleExternalContract` is not completed yet. Use it to protect your `execute` and `withdraw` functions.

### Checkpoint 5: 🚢 Ship it 🚁

📡 Edit the `defaultNetwork` to [your choice of public EVM networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/) in `packages/hardhat-ts/hardhat.config.ts`

👩‍🚀 You will want to run `yarn account` to see if you have a **deployer address**

🔐 If you don't have one, run `yarn generate` to create a mnemonic and save it locally for deploying.

⛽️ You will need to send ETH to your **deployer address** with your wallet.

> 🚀 Run `yarn deploy` to deploy your smart contract to a public network (selected in hardhat.config.js)

---

### Checkpoint 6: 🎚 Frontend 🧘‍♀️

> 📝 Edit the `targetNetworkInfo` in `providersConfig.ts` (in `packages/vite-app-ts/src/config`) to be the public network where you deployed your smart contract.

> 💻 View your frontend at http://localhost:3000/

👩‍🎤 Take time to craft your user experience...

📡 When you are ready to ship the frontend app...

📦 Run `yarn build` to package up your frontend.

💽 Upload your app to surge with `yarn surge` (you could also `yarn s3` or maybe even `yarn ipfs`?)

> 📝 you will use this deploy URL to submit to [SpeedRun](https://speedrunethereum.com).

🚔 Traffic to your url might break the [Infura](https://infura.io/) rate limit, edit your key: `constants.ts` in `packages/vite-app-ts/src/models/constants`.

---

### Checkpoint 7: 📜 Contract Verification

Update the api-key in packages/hardhat/package.json file. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> Now you are ready to run the `yarn verify --network your_network` command to verify your contracts on etherscan 🛰
